## 🚨 Problem

Citizens struggle to understand bureaucratic documents due to:

- Complex legal language
- Scattered requirements across multiple pages
- Hidden deadlines and fees
- Multilingual barriers
- Dependence on intermediaries/agents

This often leads to:
- Application rejections
- Delays in approvals
- Missed deadlines
- Lack of access to public services

---

## 💡 Solution

**Bureaucracy Whisperer** transforms complex documents into:

- Step-by-step workflows  
- Deadline tracking

- Multilingual explanations  
- Interactive question answering  

From **PDF → Actionable guidance.**

## 🤖 AI Approach

The system uses AI for contextual reasoning — not rule-based parsing.

Core components:

- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Semantic document understanding
- Structured task extraction
- Legal language simplification
- Confidence-based reasoning
- Citation-grounded responses

This enables interpretation of unstructured legal documents at scale.
